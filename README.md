    This project was developed as part of the Digital Systems class in my Software Engineering Major. 
    <br />The goal of the project was to create an Andorid app that could solve Nurikabe puzzles by detecting a 5x5 grid in a photo/image.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[Nurikabe](https://www.puzzle-nurikabe.com) is played on a NxN grid that is detected from a photo or image by the app and then converted to a simple NxN matrix. It is then solved by a strategy based algorithm and shown on screen. <br>
These requirements make it a three step project:
* **Detection**: the image is firstly analized using Image Processing operations supported by the OpenCV for Java library
* **Conversion**: the result is then converted to a matrix using a [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/Stikinit/NuriCheat/tree/master/app/src/main/ml) that was pre-trained using the famous [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset for digit recognition.
* **Solution**: Finally the solution is found using a sequence of complex [strategies](https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/nurikabe/techniques) based on the puzzle's rules and constraints.

### Built With

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [OpenCV for Java](https://opencv.org/)
* [MNIST-trained CNN](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/tfgan/eval/mnist/logits/1)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
* Git
* Android Studio

### Installation

1. Install Git at [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/download).
2. Clone the repo.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Stikinit/NuriCheat
   ```
3. Download the latest version of Android Studio.
4. Download [OpenCV Java version 3.4.10](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/3.4.10/opencv-3.4.10-android-sdk.zip/download)
5. Add the project directory on Android Studio: File > New > Import Project > Select Project Directory from Explorer.
6. Install OpenCV Java by following [these steps](https://medium.com/android-news/a-beginners-guide-to-setting-up-opencv-android-library-on-android-studio-19794e220f3c).



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To use the application either:
* Run the app using the simulated Android Studio Device.
* Install the app on your own device (Android 7.0 or more).



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Stikinit/NuriCheat/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

### Open Issues
* The cells of the in-game grid can be modified freely by selecting them.
* The digit recognition is not always perfect on the number 2.

### Future developments
* Bigger grid.
* Optimization of the solving algorithm.
* Recognition of numbers with multiple digits.
* Choice for immediate photo from camera or image selection from gallery.
